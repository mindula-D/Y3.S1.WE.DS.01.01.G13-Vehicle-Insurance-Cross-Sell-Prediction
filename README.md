## Background

Our project centers around leveraging data analytics and machine learning to enhance cross-selling strategies within the insurance sector.

In the competitive insurance industry, our project focuses on predicting customer behavior related to vehicle insurance purchases and upgrades, maximizing revenue through effective cross-selling in the intersection of insurance and vehicle sectors

Cross-selling insurance products, particularly in the context of vehicles, requires a deep understanding of customer behavior, market dynamics, and risk factors, all of which underscore the importance of predictive analysis.

By predicting cross-selling opportunities, this project enables tailored marketing, personalized policies, and enhanced customer engagement, ensuring sustained business growth in the insurance and vehicle sectors
